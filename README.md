Analyzing the Pricing of Airlines by Their Market Shares of Cities Around the United States


**A1. Research Question
**

To what extent does an airline's market share of a city affect the overall price of flights? This information would be helpful for people who are seeking the best deal on flights from their local airports. While it is not the only aspect to consider when choosing their flight, I believe, however, it is something that will be helpful for people in finding the correct airline for their ongoing flights.

**A2. Project Scope
**

The price of everything is rising, and as such, the cost of air travel is rising as well. People who choose to fly need to get the best deal for their travels. There are multiple reasons to select any given airline such as the cost of flight, amenities, and route options to name just a few. There have been recent spikes in flight tickets from departing cities where certain airlines appear to have a major market share. Finding out if this is happening, with either one airline specifically, or with multiple airlines and to what extent it is or is not happening would benefit people and provide more knowledge of why airlines are charging the amount they are charging.

**A3. Solution Overview
**

For this project, I downloaded a dataset from Kaggle.com and used a Jupyter Notebook as the testing environment, as well as Python as the programming language within the environment. This combination allowed me to perform various calculations and data manipulations on the dataset accurately. Upon loading the dataset and any needed libraries for the project, I first went about looking into the data and what columns I believed I needed. I determined that I only needed a few columns such as the average fare, the average fare from the largest carrier, the market share from the largest carrier, and the origin airport for my analysis. I cleaned the data and went to work both visualizing the data and performing data manipulation to test and determine my hypothesis.
